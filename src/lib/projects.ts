base grounds every answer in real office info rather than letting the model improvise.`,

		],
		overview: `A production-style cloud/AI platform built across a Raspberry Pi 5 (control-plane, DNS, data
tier) and a GPU desktop (K3s worker, local LLM inference), taken through an 18-step roadmap end to end:
Linux administration, Docker to Kubernetes migration, FastAPI + Postgres/pgvector + Redis, RAG over a
local Ollama LLM, Prometheus/Grafana observability, CI/CD with GitOps via Argo CD, Ansible and Terraform,
security hardening, load and failure testing. Every phase is documented with what was actually built, real
bugs found while building it, and the verification evidence for each — not just "it worked."

The engineering value here isn't the roadmap itself, it's what surfaced while running it for real: a
security gap where firewall rules never actually applied to Kubernetes traffic due to iptables chain
ordering; a GitOps credential-rotation mistake that cascaded into an unrelated Windows networking bug on
the WSL2-based worker node; a retry/timeout gap that let a dead AI backend hang requests for minutes
instead of failing fast, found by deliberately breaking things and root-caused from the actual code, then
fixed and re-verified against the live, deployed fix. A small in-cluster dashboard (FastAPI, pinned to the
Pi so it stays up even when the desktop is pulled out of the cluster) shows live status and can trigger a
"gaming mode" - cordon and drain the desktop node over SSH so a game gets the machine's full CPU/GPU, then
rejoin it to the cluster afterward.`,
		features: [
			'Two-node K3s cluster (Pi control-plane + WSL2 desktop worker) with GitOps via Argo CD - selfHeal drift correction confirmed in ~11s',
			'FastAPI backend with rate limiting, retries, structured logging, and Prometheus metrics, backed by Postgres/pgvector + Redis',
			'RAG pipeline over a fully local Ollama LLM - no data leaves the network',
			'CI/CD: GitHub Actions builds multi-arch images, pushes to GHCR, and commits the new tag - Argo CD does the actual deploying',
			'Secrets encrypted at rest with SOPS + age, applied out-of-band from the GitOps sync path',
			'Load tested with k6 (0% errors at ~480 req/s sustained) and failure tested with real fault injection (pod kills, dependency outages, a stopped AI backend) - findings cross-checked against Prometheus/Grafana, not just client-side output',
			'A cluster status dashboard with a live gaming-mode toggle that cordons/drains the desktop node over SSH and hands it back afterward'
		],
		roadmap: [
			'Streaming (SSE/websocket) output for the gaming-mode toggle instead of a blocking request',
			'A second Prometheus scrape target for the desktop’s own GPU/host metrics',
			'Multi-tenant API keys, to make the rate limiter’s per-key design actually load-testable at scale'
